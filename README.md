# Obsidian Color Text Plugin
## TODO
- [x] Add modal for choosing colors
	- [ ] ~~Intial step: support list of colors~~
	- [ ] ~~Add support for user chosen Hex codes~~
 	- [ ] ~~Add support for other color formats~~
 	- [X] Add color picker (wheel/box format). Apparently built into HTML
- [X] Allow text color to be changed to different colors
- [ ] Hide HTML upon initially changing color
	- [ ] Add setting to always hide color text (may be forced to hide all markdown info)
- [ ] Ensure that when switching colors, only uses original text and not HTML (if there is already other HTML formatting, it should not overwrite)

### Potential Goals
- [ ] Add support for other forms of text formatting
