# Obsidian Color Text Plugin

## TODO

-   [x] Add modal for choosing colors
    -   [ ] ~~Intial step: support list of colors~~
    -   [ ] ~~Add support for user chosen Hex codes~~
    -   [ ] ~~Add support for other color formats~~
    -   [x] Add color picker (wheel/box format). Apparently built into HTML
-   [x] Allow text color to be changed to different colors
-   [ ] Hide HTML upon initially changing color
    -   [ ] Add setting to always hide color text (may be forced to hide all markdown info)
-   [x] Ensure that when switching colors, only uses original text and not HTML (if there is already other HTML formatting, it should not overwrite)
    -   [ ] Switching colors w/ partially overlapping html

### Potential Goals

-   [ ] Add support for other forms of text formatting
-   [ ] Markdown formatting inside HTML (likely not possible in Obsidian)
